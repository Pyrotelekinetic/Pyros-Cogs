# Selfbot Cogs From Pyro
Official repo for Pyrotelekinetic's many super-useful cogs for [Appu's Selfbot](https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot). I recomend installing these cogs via LyricLy's [ASCII](https://github.com/LyricLy/ASCII)\(Appu Selfbot Cog Importable Index) Repo. Use `>cog help` for instructions.

### Thanks to:

[LyricLy](https://github.com/LyricLy)- for help and ideas as well as helping me learn Python in the first place™

[astronautlevel2](https://github.com/astronautlevel2)- for updating wide.py for rewrite compatability

[appu1232](https://github.com/appu1232)- for writing the actual bot

__Please note:__

I have a license now™

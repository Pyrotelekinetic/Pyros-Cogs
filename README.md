# Selfbot Cogs From Pyro
Official repo for Pyrotelekinetic's many super-useful custom cogs for [Appu's Selfbot](https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot). I recomend installing via LyricLy's [ASCII](https://github.com/LyricLy/ASCII)\(Appu Selfbot Cog Importable Index) Repo. Use `>cog help` for instructions on installing cogs with ASCII.

### Thanks to:
